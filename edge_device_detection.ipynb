    "This code defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image processing tasks. The CNN comprises layers designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Here's a brief overview of its structure and functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization (__init__):** The model initializes with two convolutional layers (conv1 and conv2) and two fully connected (linear) layers (fc1 and fc2). The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, while the fully connected layers perform classification based on these features.\n",
    "- **Convolutional Layers:** The first layer (conv1) takes an input with 3 color channels (assuming RGB images) and produces 16 feature maps using a kernel size of 3x3 with a stride of 1. The second layer (conv2) takes these 16 feature maps as input and outputs 32 feature maps, also with a 3x3 kernel and stride of 1. These layers help in capturing patterns such as edges, textures, and other visual elements from the images.\n",
    "- **Pooling:** After each convolutional layer, a max pooling operation reduces the spatial size of the representation, decreasing the number of parameters and computation in the network, and thereby controlling overfitting.\n",
    "- **Fully Connected Layers:** Before reaching the first fully connected layer (fc1), the feature map is flattened. The fc1 layer has 128 neurons and is followed by the output layer (fc2), which has a number of neurons equal to the maximum number of labels in the dataset, allowing the model to classify images into multiple categories based on the learned features.\n",
    "- **Forward Pass (forward):** Defines the forward propagation of the input through the CNN. It sequentially applies ReLU activations after convolutional layers, performs max pooling, flattens the output, and passes it through fully connected layers with ReLU activation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's architecture is designed to be adjusted based on the specific dimensions of the resized input images and the unique requirements of the dataset (e.g., the number of labels). This flexibility allows the CNN to be tailored to a wide range of image recognition tasks."

    "This snippet outlines the training process for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, focusing on handling multi-label image classification. The training loop iterates over the dataset multiple times (epochs), each time processing batches of images and their corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epoch Iteration:** The outer loop iterates through the dataset for a predefined number of epochs, allowing the model to learn from the entire dataset multiple times.\n",
    "- **Batch Processing:** Within each epoch, the inner loop iterates over batches of images and labels. Each batch is processed through the model to generate predictions (outputs).\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding of Labels:** Since the task involves multi-label classification, labels are converted into a one-hot encoded format. This format matches the model's output, allowing for direct comparison. Labels for each image are encoded such that each label's presence is marked with a 1, while absence (or padding) is marked with a 0.\n",
    "- **Loss Calculation:** The loss is computed using the model's predictions and the one-hot encoded labels. This loss measures how well the model's predictions match the actual labels, guiding the optimization process.\n",
    "- **Optimization:** The backward pass calculates gradients for the model's parameters based on the loss. The optimizer then updates the model's weights to minimize the loss, using the learning rate to determine the size of the step towards loss minimization.\n",
    "- **Logging:** The loop prints out the loss at regular intervals, providing insights into how the model's performance improves over time.\n",
    "- **Completion:** After training through all epochs, the process concludes, and the model is considered trained, ready for evaluation or deployment."
